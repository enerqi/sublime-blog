Hello World! Ok, that's a start.

This has been more than 10 years in the making. Yes, more than 10 years since I thought about writing a blog post
on what I see or saw as the problems with Java programming or predominantly mutable object oriented programming or...
many other points of software development. Why so long to write anything? I guess it's hard to find the time to
create content that doesn't need a lot of investment - a long written well-structured article - or the content is
so small that it probably has gone into a [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) question. Hopefully, there is some middle ground been
pure Q&A and a longer structured article. Write something, any notes, and more may follow.

Why write at all? There's the argument that it improves communications skills. Yes, but I did enough of that during
a philosophy degree. I've also done some company internal blog posts in the past related to performance testing, but
that wasn't on my own time.

Self-advertisement perhaps. Writing about a specific topic can certainly show some knowledge. As a software engineer
(or "digital solutions provider" to sound more encompassing) I really appreciate the articles that some individuals or
companies put out to help other engineers build something. It makes me think that I'd hire that company if I needed
to do that specific thing. It's more than a portfolio in that it shows the construction process and not just the
finished artifact. There maybe some other skills evident from building a blog e.g. setting up web servers, DNS, domain
names and site generators; but the blog could also be a paid for hosted solution.

A place to take notes on different topics perhaps. Sure, a post doesn't have to be a thing
of elegance and beauty. I take a lot of notes, about anything, in plain text - todos, technology, household info. It's
easy to sync text between different machines/devices with services like [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/), DropBox,
One Note and the like. As this blog post is generated from markdown text, a post could just be some published notes.

Sharing experiences that are rarer maybe the most relevant. For example, most professional software development I do
these days uses the Python programming language but the way it's structured / architected owes more to
functional first languages such as [F#](http://fsharp.org/).

We shall see.
